<h1 class="title">Don't fake steps</h1>
<p>
Recently a company I work started a charity event where it challenges its employees to reach 70.0000.000 steps in total. If reached it will double the donation to charity.<br><br>
  
Naturally I was really excited to have the opportunity to contribute to such a noble cause. <br><br>

Unfortunately, I'm not really a walker so after some digging I found that making specific changes to the gyroscope/accelaration sensors in an emulator would mimic walking. So with the help of Chat-GTP I wrote and tweaked a script that would continously change these sensors and effectively 'walk' while the emulator is running. <br><br>

But seeing all these people doing their best, walking in the morning and evening for a good cause, made me think about my actions. My consience kicked in and I decided to pull out of the race. Either way, it was fun playing around with the emulator and we learned some lessons along the way.
