<h1 class="title">How to walk in Steptember</h1>
<p>
Recently a company I work started a charity event where it challenges its employees to reach 70.0000.000 steps in total. If reached it will double the donation to charity.<br><br>
  
Naturally I was really excited to have the opportunity to contribute to such a noble cause. <br><br>

Unfortunately, I'm not really a walker so I decided to see if I could do something with the app. With a proxy tool, I found the request the app is making to the server with the amount of steps you made. Sadly, it wasn't as easy as changing the step value in the request to achieve a much higher step amount than what you actually walked. <br><br>

It seems the app is generating a hash when the request is made, and if anything in the request is altered it fails the check on the server-side. It would probably take me considerably more effort to reverse the method they use to create the hash than just to take the 10K steps :). <br><br>

I started to play around with the app in the emulator and tried to set a gps route and see if it would work. The app did actually register the amount of KM walked but it didn't register any steps. After some digging I found that making specific changes to the gyroscope/accelaration sensors is needed to simulate a walking motion. So with the help of Chat-GTP I wrote and tweaked a script that would continously change these sensors and effectively 'walk' while the emulator is running. <br><br>

But after seeing all my colleagues doing their best, walking morning and night for a good cause and cheering each other on, while I was sitting on my lazy ass trying to win made me think about my actions. My consience kicked in and I decided to pull out of the race. Either way, it was fun playing around with the emulator and we learned some lessons along the way.
