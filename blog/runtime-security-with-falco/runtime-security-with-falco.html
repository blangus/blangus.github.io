<h1 class="title">Runtime security with Falco</h1>
<p></p>
<h3>-- Introduction</h3>
<p>Lately I've been researching possibilities to detect anomalies during runtime in containers. I came across Sysdig’s open source project <a href="https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco">Falco</a> which seems to do just that. Quoted from their site: "Falco, the open source cloud-native runtime security project, is the defacto Kubernetes threat detection engine. Falco detects unexpected application behavior and alerts on threats at runtime."<br><br>

Sounds good..<br><br>

<h3>-- How does it work?</h3>
Falco runs as a privileged container and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter">eBFP</a> to capture system calls. Events that match a certain filter expression (rule) result in an alert which can be outputted in different ways (for example as a push message to Slack). It comes pre-equipped with a lot of essential rules and has the possibility to be extended with custom rules.<br><br>

Below is a simple example taken from <a href="https://falco.org/docs/rules/">Falco’s manual</a> of a condition that alerts whenever a bash shell is run inside a container.<br>

<code><pre class="prettyprint">container.id != host and proc.name = bash</pre></code>

The first clause checks that the event happened in a container (Sysdig events have a container field that is equal to "host" if the event happened on a regular host). The second clause checks that the process name is bash. Note that this condition does not even include a clause with a system call! It only checks event metadata. Because of that, if a bash shell does start up in a container, Falco outputs events for every syscall that is performed by that shell.<br><br>

Here is another example of a rule that triggers when an attacker manages to start netcat on a victim’s container.<br>
<code><pre class="prettyprint">
- macro: network_tool_procs
  condition: (proc.name in (network_tool_binaries))

- list: network_tool_binaries
  items: [nc, ncat, nmap, dig, tcpdump, tshark, ngrep, telnet, mitmproxy, socat]

- rule: Launch Suspicious Network Tool in Container
  desc: Detect network tools launched inside container
  condition: >
    spawned_process and container and network_tool_procs
  output: >
    Network tool launched in container (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline parent_process=%proc.pname
    container_id=%container.id container_name=%container.name image=%container.image.repository:%container.image.tag)
  priority: NOTICE
  tags: [network, process, mitre_discovery, mitre_exfiltration]</pre></code>

Fun fact: the ‘condition’ field uses the <a href="https://github.com/draios/sysdig/wiki/sysdig-user-guide#filtering">Sysdig filter syntax</a>.<br><br>

To make things more clear, i've made a demo below which shows Falco in action.<br><br>

<h3>-- Set-up Demo</h3>

My test set-up consists of two docker containers. One is Falco running as a privileged container and the second one is a vulnerable website built by <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/web-dvwa">DVWA</a> running in a separate container. As can bee seen below, once I try to execute a command in the container through command injection in the website Falco matches the event with one of its rules and forwards the alert to Slack.<br><br><br>

<h3>-- Further reads</h3>
I would strongly recommend to read <a href="https://medium.com/@SkyscannerEng/kubernetes-security-monitoring-at-scale-with-sysdig-falco-a60cfdb0f67a">Skyscanner's article</a> about their experiences implementing Falco within their Kubernetes clusters.<br><br>
